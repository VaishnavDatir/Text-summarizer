# Text Summarizer

## A NLP Project

A text summarizer is an online tool that wraps up a text to a specified short length. It condenses a long article to main points. The need for text summarizers are increasing day by day, because of time constraints. People are looking for shortcut methods to learn ideas in lesser time.

This project is made using Python NLP and HTML
